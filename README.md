# Skeleton

`skeleton` `fun` `shell scripting with python`

---
A quick project skeleton for easily starting new Python Application projects.

### What does skeleton script do?
This copies the contents of the `template` to a sibling directory `foo` and then:
- substitutes some templates
- init git repo there
- create a virtual environment via the pipenv module
- setup git commit hooks via the pre-commit package if git was inited
